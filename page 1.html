  <p>
    “A 100g of boiled, thick cow skin contains about 224.65kcal of energy, 6.80g of carbohydrate, about 43.9g of water,
    46.9g of protein, 1.09g of fat, and 0.02g of fibre. For micronutrients, it contains small amounts of calcium (61mg),
    iron (4.3mg), magnesium (12mg), phosphorus (36mg) and Zinc (6.79mg).Although Ponmo has low nutritional value when
    compared to other protein sources because it doesn’t contain all essential amino acids, it contains a lot of
    collagen which is the most abundant protein in our bodies. Because our bodies produce collagen, it is not essential
    that we must eat collagen for growth. However, as we grow older, our ability to produce collagen reduces leading us
    to have wrinkles.”</p>
